This script opens a webcam stream and applies the Holistic model on each frame
 to detect and visualize face and hand landmarks.
It displays the results in a window that updates in real-time.
The script stops when the 'q' key is pressed.
Ensure you have MediaPipe and OpenCV installed to run this script successfully.
